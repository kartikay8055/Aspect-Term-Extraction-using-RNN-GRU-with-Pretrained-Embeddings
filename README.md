# Aspect-Term-Extraction-using-RNN-GRU-with-Pretrained-Embeddings
This repository contains the implementation of Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) using RNN and GRU models with pretrained GloVe and fastText embeddings. The task involves extracting aspect terms from sentences and categorizing them using BIO encoding.
